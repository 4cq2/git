## Byron/gitoxide

unrecognized subcommand 'clone'

the README:

https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/main/README.md

shows this command:

~~~
gix clone https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide gitoxide-clones-itself
~~~

but if I try that command, it fails:

~~~
error: unrecognized subcommand 'clone'

Usage: gix.exe [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
~~~

I built `gix` just now using the `main` branch.

module is not pure Go

the current description says:

> A Pure Go Git Implementation 

this is not true. If I run a diff, everything looks normal:

~~~
> dgit diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
--- a/filter/README.md
+++ b/filter/README.md
@@ -4,3 +4,5 @@

 You shouldn't use it either.

+asdf
~~~

but then I discovered that it only works because its calling `diff` from my
path. this is evidenced by it breaking when you clear the path:

~~~
> $env:path = ''
> dgit diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
~~~

so not only is it not pure Go, but its calling an external executable. and to
top it off, it fails without error.

## git-for-windows/git

git push fails without credential.helper

If I download this:

https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.39.2.windows.1/MinGit-2.39.2-busybox-64-bit.zip

and remove these from `etc/gitconfig`:

~~~init
[credential]
   helper = manager
~~~

any `git push` after that fails:

~~~
bash: can't create /dev/tty: nonexistent directory
error: failed to execute prompt script (exit code 1)
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such file or
directory
~~~

according to the docs, Git should have a fallback when a credential helper is
not defined:

## gogs/git-module

clarify project purpose

I think it should be more clear that this package is just a wrapper for the
command line Git tool:

https://github.com/gogs/git-module/blob/7f9509a611f7bd3bba64aacbb78b9c00137bb144/repo.go#L127-L142

the current description "Git access through shell commands", someone could
think that the "shell commands" are provided by this module itself

## jelmer/dulwich

KeyError: b'HEAD'

I can create a new repo with Git, `git add` a change, then add another change,
and `git diff` the index with worktree:

~~~
> git init
> 'hello world' > hello.txt
> git add hello.txt
> 'world hello' >> hello.txt
> git diff
diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
index f35d3e6..d87f0a5 100644
--- a/hello.txt
+++ b/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello world
+world hello
~~~

but Dulwich fails on the diff:

~~~
